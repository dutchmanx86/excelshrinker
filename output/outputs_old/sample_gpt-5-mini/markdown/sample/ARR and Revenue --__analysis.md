## 1. Spreadsheet Overview
- **Sheet Name**: ARR and Revenue -->
- **Key Sections Identified**:
  - ARR Summary / Movement (New, Expansion, Contraction, Churn, Net ARR)
  - Revenue Time Series (MRR / ARR / Recognized Revenue)
  - Cohort Analysis / Revenue by Cohort
  - Revenue Waterfall / Contribution Bridge (by component)

  - Assumptions & Drivers (rates, pricing, cohorts)

> Important note: the provided JSON extraction contains no cell-level data (cells_analyzed = 0). Exact cell ranges were not returned in the input. The section names above are inferred from the sheet name ("ARR and Revenue -->") and common spreadsheet practices. Precise cell ranges and detected date labels are not available in the provided data. Each detailed section below therefore lists the intended logical mapping and purpose and explicitly states that precise cell ranges/date cells were not detected. To produce exact A1-style ranges, please provide an extraction that includes cell coordinates or a full workbook export.

## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### ARR Summary / Movement
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table (ARR roll-forward / Movement)
- **Description & Purpose**: Presents the top-level ARR components and movements over the reporting horizon — typically shows opening ARR, New ARR (adds), Expansion ARR, Contraction ARR, Churn ARR, and Net ARR change for each period. Used for high-level revenue health and trend analysis.
- **Cell Range**: Not available in provided extraction (cells_analyzed = 0). Cannot determine exact A1-range without cell coordinates.
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not detected. Typically dates are in the header row across columns (e.g., C?:Z?); could also be a column for period labels with values across columns.
  - **Date Range**: Unknown (commonly Monthly or Quarterly; could be historical + forecast).
  - **Frequency**: Unknown (most ARR sheets are Monthly or Quarterly).
- **Key Components**:
  - Opening ARR
  - New ARR (new business)
  - Expansion ARR (upsells)
  - Contraction / Downgrades
  - Churned ARR
  - Net New ARR and Closing ARR
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Sheet name suggests an ARR-first focus; this section may include both ARR and Annualized revenues.
  - May include year-to-date and rolling 12-month (LTM) aggregates.

### Revenue Time Series (MRR / Recognized Revenue)
- **Section Type**: Standard Time Series Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Detailed revenue by time period (MRR, recognized revenue, billings) to support trend analysis, forecasting, and reconciliation to ARR. Often used to produce charts and to feed financial models.
- **Cell Range**: Not available in provided extraction (cells_analyzed = 0). Exact cell coordinates required to map.
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not detected. Typically located in a single header row (e.g., row 3) spanning multiple columns, or as a left-hand column of dates with metrics across columns.
  - **Date Range**: Unknown — commonly covers prior 12–36 months plus a forecast horizon.
  - **Frequency**: Likely Monthly or Quarterly.
- **Key Components**:
  - MRR / ARR columns
  - Recognized revenue vs billed revenue
  - Segmentation (product, region, ARR vs one-time)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - May include both ARR-converted metrics (annualized) and actual monthly recognized revenue lines.
  - Could have separate blocks for historical vs forecast.

### Cohort Analysis / Revenue by Cohort
- **Section Type**: Cohort Table / Cohort Retention Matrix
- **Description & Purpose**: Tracks cohorts by acquisition period and shows retention, expansion, and churn patterns over time. Used to analyze unit economics and retention behavior.
- **Cell Range**: Not available in provided extraction (cells_analyzed = 0).
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not detected. Cohort sheets usually have cohort start dates in the first column and subsequent period offsets as column headers.
  - **Date Range**: Unknown — typically cohort periods (monthly or quarterly) across a 12–36 period horizon.
  - **Frequency**: Usually Monthly or Quarterly.
- **Key Components**:
  - Cohort start date / acquisition period
  - Retention/ARP per cohort over time
  - Metrics: cohort size, retention %, revenue per cohort
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - May include normalized metrics (indexing to 100%) and absolute ARR contributions.
  - Could be implemented as a triangular matrix or as stacked columns.

### Revenue Waterfall / Contribution Bridge
- **Section Type**: Waterfall Chart Data / Bridge Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Breaks the change in ARR or revenue between two periods into components (New, Expansion, Contraction, Churn, FX, M&A). Used to explain delta between opening and closing ARR.
- **Cell Range**: Not available in provided extraction (cells_analyzed = 0).
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not detected. Usually the waterfall is a small block with period-to-period labels (e.g., columns for Opening, Changes, Closing).
  - **Date Range**: Typically compares two points (e.g., opening vs closing period) or shows sequential monthly/quarterly waterfalls.
  - **Frequency**: Often Quarterly or Monthly snapshots.
- **Key Components**:
  - Opening ARR / revenue
  - Component contributions (New, Expansion, Contraction, Churn, Other)
  - Closing ARR / revenue
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - May include percentages and absolute values; may drive a chart on the same sheet.

### KPI Dashboard / Key Metrics
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table / Dashboard
- **Description & Purpose**: Consolidated high-level KPIs — growth rates, churn rate, CAC payback, LTV, ARPA, ARR growth — for quick executive insight and as inputs into slides and forecasts.
- **Cell Range**: Not available in provided extraction (cells_analyzed = 0).
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not detected. KPIs often display current period and comparisons (MoM, YoY) with sparklines referencing the time series.
  - **Date Range**: Varies — typically shows latest period plus short historical context.
  - **Frequency**: Typically Monthly or Quarterly.
- **Key Components**:
  - Growth rates (period-over-period, YoY)
  - Churn metrics (logo churn, revenue churn)
  - Unit economics (ARPA, CAC, LTV:LTV)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Dashboard may contain conditional formatting, KPI thresholds, and visual elements that are not extractable without cell-level metadata.

### Assumptions & Drivers
- **Section Type**: Assumptions Table / Input Drivers
- **Description & Purpose**: Contains model inputs and assumptions that feed revenue calculations — pricing, churn rates by cohort, conversion rates, uplift/expansion rates. Used for sensitivity testing and scenario runs.
- **Cell Range**: Not available in provided extraction (cells_analyzed = 0).
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not applicable for single-value assumptions; some assumptions may be time-phased across columns (not detected).
  - **Date Range**: N/A or variable if time-phased.
  - **Frequency**: N/A or matches the model frequency when time-phased.
- **Key Components**:
  - Pricing tiers, churn rates, expansion rates, acquisition assumptions, ARR recognition rules
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Often contains named ranges or input cells that are referenced across the workbook; these must be exported with cell addresses to map dependencies.

Final remark: Because the provided JSON contains no cell-level mapping (cells_analyzed = 0 and no format_ranges), I cannot supply the exact A1 ranges or precise date-cell coordinates requested. To produce a fully actionable mapping (exact Cell Range and Dates Location values), please re-submit an extraction that includes cell coordinates or provide the workbook/worksheet export (for example, an HTML or CSV export per region or a full XLSX). Once cell addresses are available I will produce the exact A1-style ranges and update the "Dates Location" and "Date Range" fields for each section.

> Notes on structure and retrieval
> - The workbook uses three primary date-series definitions (ds_1, ds_2, ds_3) to support annual, repeating-annual, and monthly timelines. The definitions are:
>   - ds_1: Annual series from 2015 to 2027
>   - ds_2: Annual values repeating 12 times from 2015 to 2027
>   - ds_3: Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2027-12
> - Time Series Dates Locations are anchored around the common header region (Year header near E6:Q6 and monthly headers in T6:FS6 / T8:FS8, with “Month” labels at B7) to provide consistent period labeling across sections.
> - Several sections use the same underlying time framework but reflect different business facets (base, growth, quotas, ARR per user). The ranges listed above are chosen to capture the entire logical block for each named section, noting overlaps where sections share rows/labels.

If you want, I can adjust the Section Ranges to be strictly limited to narrower contiguous blocks or re-group sections by broader business themes (e.g., “Revenue Scenarios,” “Quota & Compensation,” “ARR by User,” and “Productivity/Seasonality”).

## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Accrued Expenses Ledger
- **Section Type**: Balance Sheet
- **Description & Purpose**: This section represents the monthly accrual liabilities tracked by account/vendor, serving as the liability/component of the balance sheet. It aggregates various accrual items (e.g., vendor-specific monthly audit accruals, annual audit accruals, and miscellaneous accrual-related entries) and culminates in a total “Accrued Expenses (USD)” figure. The data structure supports period-by-period visibility (monthly) across multiple accounts, with currency and unit considerations reflected in header rows and certain columns.
- **Cell Range**: D3:AB49
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: E1:AB1
  - **Date Range**: 2020-01 to 2021-12
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Vendor/Expense lines and categories (e.g., Deloitte; Monthly audit accrual; UK; various MSCI-related items; Transcripts-related lines)
  - Currency and header information (Euro, GBP) and a multi-month date axis
  - Totals row for Accrued Expenses (USD)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The sheet uses a multi-currency setup (Euro in C1, GBP in C2) and a monthly time axis across E1:AB1.
  - Many numeric columns apply a scale factor of 1000 (e.g., F4:Q4, G7:AB7, F34:AB34, etc.), indicating units are displayed in thousands.
  - The data block appears to mix accrual entries with ancillary financial references (MSCI-related items, Transcripts, TR Transcripts) rather than a single standardized P&L format.
  - External data sources are referenced via a dictionary-style inverted index. The actual source mappings (resolved values) include:
    - In USD: D12, D45, D47
    - 66100--DataFeeds: B15:B24, B26
    - LexisNexis: A35:A36
    - AWS: A39:A40
    - Factset Sell side research: A41:A42

Notes on resolution of dictionary references:
- The spreadsheet’s dictionary mappings indicate external data source anchors. For clarity and retrieval, the actual values (cell references) are provided above rather than placeholders. This enables precise linking to data sources when needed.

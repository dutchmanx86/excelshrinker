## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Time Series Data Format & Blocks
- **Section Type**: Time Series Layout
- **Description & Purpose**: This section defines the dual time-series axes used on the sheet: a quarterly header block and a monthly header block. It anchors how time-period data is aligned and consumed by downstream calculations or analyses, enabling time-indexed data retrieval across two parallel series on a single sheet.
- **Cell Range**: B1:S16
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: B1:G1; B10:S10
  - **Date Range**:
    - ds_1 (Quarterly): 2017-Q1 to 2018-Q2
    - ds_2 (Monthly): 2017-01 to 2018-06
  - **Frequency**:
    - ds_1: Quarterly
    - ds_2: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Dual time-series headers, date-series blocks, and the surrounding numeric blocks that rely on these headers for period-based data alignment.
- **Notes & Customizations**: The sheet employs two distinct time-series definitions (one quarterly, one monthly) within the same layout, which is a non-standard arrangement for typical single-period financial reports. This setup supports cross-period analyses but requires careful mapping when retrieving period-specific data.

### Data Dictionary / Category Mappings (Inverted Index)
- **Section Type**: Data Dictionary Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section defines how rows in the sheet are categorized into semantic groups. It maps category names to their corresponding row locations, enabling quick interpretation of labeled data blocks and aggregation by category in downstream analyses.
- **Cell Range**: A2:A15
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: N/A
  - **Date Range**: N/A
  - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Category labels resolved from the dictionary values: Corporate, Financial, Other, Broker Partner
- **Notes & Customizations**: The mapping uses a compact set of non-contiguous row references to assign each category to its relevant rows (e.g., Corporate spans A2 and A12; Financial spans A3, A5, A11, A13; Other spans A4 and A14; Broker Partner spans A6 and A15). This suggests downstream processing relies on grouping rows by these category anchors.

### Compression Statistics
- **Section Type**: Data Efficiency Metrics
- **Description & Purpose**: This section captures metrics related to the data compression process applied to the dataset. It provides insights into storage efficiency, sparsity, and the effectiveness of the compression algorithm for retrieval and transfer.
- **Cell Range**: N/A (Embedded in JSON; no explicit Excel cell block is provided for these metrics in the supplied data)
- **Time Series Horizon**: N/A
- **Key Components**: High-level metrics such as:
  - unique_values
  - entries_moved_to_index
  - entries_remaining
  - min_occurrences_threshold
  - original_size_bytes
  - compressed_size_bytes
  - inverted_index_size_bytes
  - compressed_data_size_bytes
  - compression_ratio
  - space_saved_bytes
  - space_saved_percent
- **Notes & Customizations**: These are derived statistics rather than standard worksheet data. They inform storage efficiency but are not tied to a specific contiguous Excel range in the provided data. If re-mapped into a sheet, these would typically reside in a dedicated "Compression Stats" block.

### Sheet Metadata & Data Provenance
- **Section Type**: Metadata / Provenance
- **Description & Purpose**: Captures provenance information about when the data structure was detected or processed, providing a reference point for data lineage and auditability.
- **Cell Range**: N/A (Provided as metadata in JSON; no explicit Excel cell block is specified)
- **Time Series Horizon**: N/A
- **Key Components**: detected_at timestamp (2025-10-14T01:55:20.345171Z)
- **Notes & Customizations**: The presence of a detection timestamp suggests an automated ingestion or analysis step that produced this structured JSON representation. It aids reproducibility and traceability of the data extraction process.

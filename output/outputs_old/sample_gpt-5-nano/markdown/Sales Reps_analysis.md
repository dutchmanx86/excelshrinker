Notes on the underlying structure and references:
- The sheet uses a defined monthly date series (ds_1) spanning 2015-01 through 2027-12, with the dates located in T2:FS2.
- The monthly horizon is consistently applied across the major blocks, enabling time-series pull of metrics for comparison and trend analysis.
- The dictionary-like entries in the data indicate structural markers (e.g., “x” markers in A5, A43, etc.) used to delineate sections, and many blocks share the same date axis for coherence.
- The data uses multiple ranges with specified scales (notably 1000) to normalize monetary values; this is important for retrieval and interpretation of aggregated numbers.

If you’d like, I can adjust the section boundaries to match any preferred segmentation (e.g., consolidate quota-related blocks into a single “Quota Performance” section, or separate Salary and Bonus into distinct sub-sections with more granular cell ranges).

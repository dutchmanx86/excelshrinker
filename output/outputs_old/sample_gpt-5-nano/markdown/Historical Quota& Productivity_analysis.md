## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Historical Quota
- **Section Type**: Custom Data Table (Quota)
- **Description & Purpose**: A time-series quota dataset that captures target values by segment over parallel annual and monthly time horizons. This section provides the basis for performance planning and variance analysis against actual productivity/throughput.
- **Cell Range**: A2:AR8
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: 
    - ds_1 (Annual): D1:G1
    - ds_2 (Monthly): I1:BG1
  - **Date Range**:
    - ds_1: 2015-01-01 to 2018 (Annual series from 2015 to 2018)
    - ds_2: 2015-01-31 to 2019-03 (Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2019-03)
  - **Frequency**:
    - ds_1: Annual
    - ds_2: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Account Manager
  - AE - Financial
  - AE - Corporate
  - AE - Enterprise
  - AE - Other
  - VP Bus Dev
  (These represent the major segments/labels arranged along the left side of the quota matrix.)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The section employs two parallel date-series blocks (split across D1:G1 and I1:BG1) to accommodate both annual and monthly views.
  - Several quota values are scaled (e.g., scale factors of 1000 in multiple cells), indicating amounts presented in thousands.
  - This block is positioned before the “Historical Productivity” section, with a clear left-column segmentation for the major groups listed above.

### Historical Productivity
- **Section Type**: Custom Data Table (Productivity)
- **Description & Purpose**: A historical productivity dataset that aggregates productivity metrics across months/periods, including dedicated rows for sub-categories such as Other and Total. This section supports trend analysis and attribution of productivity by segment over time.
- **Cell Range**: A11:AR22
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**:
    - Primary date headers: I12:AT12 and AU12:BG12
  - **Date Range**:
    - Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2019-03 (consistent with the ds_2 monthly pattern)
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Other (category label appears at A17)
  - Total (category label appears at A19)
  - Productivity data blocks across D12:E12, F12 (scaled), I12:AT12, AU12:BG12, etc., representing monthly measures by sub-block and segment
  - Rows/blocks that imply grouped monthly data plus a Total row, enabling overall and per-segment productivity comparisons
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The productivity section uses substantial multi-block ranges (e.g., D12:E12, I12:AT12, AU12:BG12; and similar patterns for subsequent rows) with many values scaled by 1000, indicating thousands-based presentation.
  - The layout includes explicit category rows such as Other and Total, which suggests a custom aggregation structure rather than a straightforward standard P&L or balance-sheet layout.
  - The block sits directly after the Quota section, with a dedicated header label positioned at A11 to denote the start of Historical Productivity.

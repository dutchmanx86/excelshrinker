## 1. Spreadsheet Overview
- **Sheet Name**: Cost of Goods Sold
- **Key Sections Identified**:
  - Cost of Goods Sold Overview (detailed COGS breakdown and aggregation)
  - Profit & Loss (P&L) & BRM/AMR Expense Data (expense-driven sections and related metrics)

## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Cost of Goods Sold Overview
- **Section Type**: Standard P&L (COGS-focused)
- **Description & Purpose**: This section encapsulates the core Cost of Goods Sold structure for the sheet, including the detailed breakdowns, totals, and segment-level components that drive gross margin analysis. It serves as the primary hub for COGS data feeding higher-level financial views.
- **Cell Range**: B1:FS672
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: T2:FS2
  - **Date Range**: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12-31
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
  - Note: The sheet defines a monthly date-series (ds_1) described as “Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2027-12.” A secondary, annual time series (ds_2) also appears in related blocks for specialized data, described as “Annual values repeating 108 times from 2000 to 2000.”
- **Key Components**: 
  - Core COGS buckets and totals (e.g., Cost of Goods Sold, Total COGS)
  - Data groupings by source/type (Financial, Corporate, Other)
  - Sub-sections such as Product Summary and COGS by Segment
- **Notes & Customizations**: 
  - Highly granular, multi-block layout with numerous sub-categories and cross-references
  - Widespread use of data scaling (e.g., scale factors of 1000) and a mix of data sources and data types
  - Includes both standard COGS aggregates and an extensive set of sub-components and sources (e.g., Financial, Corporate, Other, News, Transcripts, Filings, International Filings, etc.)

### Profit & Loss (P&L) Overview
- **Section Name**: P&L
- **Section Type**: Custom P&L / P&L Summary (expense-driven)
- **Description & Purpose**: This portion represents the higher-level Profit & Loss view tied to COGS-related activities and related operating expenses, including BRM/AMR-related costs, various data-service expenses, and related revenue/expense lines. It functions as the layered, end-to-end P&L narrative beyond the core COGS blocks.
- **Cell Range**: B674:FS816
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: T2:FS2
  - **Date Range**: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12-31
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
  - Note: As with the COGS overview, the monthly ds_1 time series pattern is used to align the P&L data with the same date headers. A secondary annual time series (ds_2) is defined and appears in related blocks, though the primary horizon here is monthly.
  - References: date_series_definitions includes ds_1 (Monthly, "Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2027-12") and ds_2 (Annual, used in ancillary blocks)
- **Key Components**:
  - Major expense and cost centers (BRM, AMR, News/Transcripts/Filings, International Filings, Broker Research, etc.)
  - Expense line items by category (e.g., TR BRM Users, Financial, S&P/Transcript related costs, Dow Jones, Lexis Nexis, FactSet, Web Service, COGS Allocation)
  - Tiered and per-user cost structures (Tier 1–Tier 14, Excess User Fees, Price per User, etc.)
  - Aggregates and totals (Total FactSet Expense, Total S&P Expense, Total Transcript Expense, Total International Filings Expense, Total News/Journal expenses, etc.)
  - P&L-level totals and cross-category sums (e.g., Total BRM, Total AMR, Total News and Journals, Total News, Total)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Extremely granular revenue/expense modeling with tiered user counts and per-user economics
  - Incorporates multi-block allocations across many data sources and services (e.g., BRM/AMR, Transcripts, News, Journals, Filings, International Filings)
  - Contains multiple non-standard grouping labels (e.g., Tier 1–Tier 14, “Excess Over Tier 5 User Limit,” “Fee Minimum,” “TR Research,” “FS RT Users,” etc.)
  - Some blocks reference cross-sheet or non-standard metric groupings, reflecting a bespoke cost-revenue model rather than a classic, off-the-shelf P&L

Notes on time-series definitions used in this document
- Primary time-series horizon (ds_1): Monthly series, start 2015-01-31, end 2027-12, described as “Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2027-12”
- Secondary time-series horizon (ds_2): Annual, repeating 108 periods starting 2000-01-01, described as “Annual values repeating 108 times from 2000 to 2000”
- Dates location (for primary series): T2:FS2 (header row with dates)
- For sections that rely on the secondary time-series (ds_2), the exact placements are shown in blocks such as BP563:FS563 and BP617:FS617, among others, but the primary horizon for the main P&L view is monthly ds_1.

Guidance for retrieval
- Core COGS data (Overview) can be retrieved from B1:FS672 with date alignment in T2:FS2 (monthly ds_1). If needed, the annual ds_2 blocks can be referenced for annual aggregations in peripheral blocks (e.g., around ds_2-labeled regions such as BP563:FS563 and BP617:FS617).
- P&L and BRM/AMR cost data can be retrieved from B674:FS816 with the same date alignment (T2:FS2) for the primary monthly horizon; annual ds_2 blocks appear in supporting rows/columns within this broader range.

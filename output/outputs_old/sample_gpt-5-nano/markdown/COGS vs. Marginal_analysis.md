## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### COGS vs Marginal Model
- **Section Type**: `Custom P&L`
- **Description & Purpose**: A tailored cost-and-margin model that contrasts current versus marginal cost structures to evaluate per-user economics. The section integrates revenue, seat counts, cost of goods sold, gross profit per seat, and margin calculations, along with calculated fee components and transcript-related/cost adjustments to inform pricing and profitability decisions.
- **Cell Range**: `B1:D102`
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: `B3:B5` (labels include "2017 Revenue" and "2017 Seats" indicating a single-year focus)
  - **Date Range**: `2017`
  - **Frequency**: `Annual`
- **Key Components**: 
  - Revenue and Seats foundation (e.g., 2017 Revenue, 2017 Seats, Revenue per Seat)
  - COGS block (COGS)
  - Per-Seat and Marginal metrics (Per-Seat, Gross Profit per Seat, % Margin)
  - Calculations and fee structures (Calculations, BRM % of Total, Monthly per User)
  - AMR and related fee/scale sections (AMR - $15k / AMR - $30k, Additional Fees, Fee per Excess User, Transcripts-related lines)
  - Miscellaneous note/placeholder areas (e.g., rows with "x" markers and notes about transcripts)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - This is a bespoke, single-sheet cost-and-margin model focusing on per-seat economics and marginal costs.
  - Includes scaling indicators (e.g., some numbers use a scale of 1000) and placeholder entries (marked as "x") for future inputs.
  - Contains explicit notes tied to transcripts and fee structures (e.g., a note describing "TR Transcripts - flat fee will be triggered so no marginal cost" and references to various transcripts-related lines) to model potential marginal-cost shifts under specific conditions.

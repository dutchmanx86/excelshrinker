Notes on interpretation and retrieval
- The sheet uses two defined time-series anchors:
  - ds_1: A repeating quarterly series starting 2016-Q1 and continuing to 2020-Q4 (3-month cadence).
  - ds_2: A monthly series starting 2015-01-31 and continuing through 2027-12 (monthly cadence).
- The time-series headers are anchored in:
  - Dates Location: AF1:CM1 (ds_1) and T2:FS2 (ds_2)
- The major sections above align with the key anchors present in the inverted_index (e.g., "ARR and Revenue Detail" at B2/B24, "New Business" at B8 with additional anchors, "Upsell" at B9, "Churn" at B10, "Revenue by Segment" at B32, "Total Bookings by Segment" at B152, "New Bookings" at B100, "Sales Headcount" blocks around B46/B53, and "Corporate ARR" at B190). The ranges chosen for each section reflect the closest contiguous span that covers the primary anchors for that section and its commonly associated sub-blocks.
- All ranges and sections are described at a high level to enable quick targeting by future AI or analysts, with precise time-series context and boundaries included to support replication or automated data retrieval.

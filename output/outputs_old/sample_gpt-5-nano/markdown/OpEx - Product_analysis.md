- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The sheet uses a highly granular breakdown of operating expenses (e.g., Personal costs down to individual line items) and includes a dedicated “Total” line for major groupings.
  - The data appears to support both monthly Totals and a Year-To-Date view (the header in B3 indicates Year To Date context).
  - Values are scaled by 1000 (thousands) for most numeric lines.
  - There are some nonstandard or typographical labels within the expense breakdown (e.g., “Omarketing Research”) which may require normalization for downstream processing.
  - This is a product-focused P&L snapshot intended for profitability analysis and monthly trend assessment. It is a custom, highly-detailed P&L rather than a minimal standard template.

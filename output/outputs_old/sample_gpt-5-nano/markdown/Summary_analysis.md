### Key Financial Drivers (Cash, Debt, ARR, Bookings, FCF)
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: A vertical collection of core financial position drivers used to assess liquidity and growth dynamics.

- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not applicable (this block presents cross-sectional values by driver, not a single time-series axis)
  - **Date Range**: N/A
  - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: 
  - Cash
  - Debt
  - ARR
  - Bookings
  - FCF
- **Notes & Customizations**: 
  - The driver blocks are vertically stacked in column B (rows 40 through 64).
  - Some values are shown with a scale factor of 1000 on accompanying ranges, indicating thousands (as identified elsewhere in the data definitions).

### KPI Dashboard: Time-Series Metrics

- **Notes & Customizations**: 
  - Several numeric blocks use a scale factor of 1000 (values presented in thousands) as indicated in the formatting rules.
  - The section relies on multiple date-series definitions (ds_1, ds_2, ds_3) to support different granularities (monthly vs. annual) and headers across columns.
  - A CHANGES narrative exists at A1:A5 indicating adjustments to costs and allocations, which serves as metadata rather than a numeric business metric within this section.

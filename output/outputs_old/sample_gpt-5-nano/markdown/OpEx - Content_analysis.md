Notes:
- The Time Series for all sections uses the same monthly periods aligned under the header "Month Ending" located at C3:U3, with dates presented in the cells D4 through I4 (03/31/2019 to 08/31/2019). The data is scaled by 1,000 for most numeric rows, as indicated in the format_ranges entries.
- The sheet structure reflects a highly granular, customized Profit & Loss (P&L) layout, with numerous indentations to denote hierarchical grouping of line items and several duplicated or closely related total lines. Net income is not explicitly labeled as a separate line; it would be computed externally as Revenue minus Total Expenses in a complete P&L interpretation.

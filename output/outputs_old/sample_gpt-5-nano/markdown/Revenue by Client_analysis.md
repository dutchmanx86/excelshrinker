### Income Statement
- **Section Type**: Standard P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: Provides a profitability snapshot over time by aggregating revenue and expense components. In this sheet, the Income Statement is embedded within the "Revenue by Client" data layout to support multi-year, monthly profitability analysis and to align with client-level revenue data.
- **Cell Range**: AM15:BJ20
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: C2:BD3
  - **Date Range**: January 2015 to December 2017
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Revenue, Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, Operating Expenses, Net Income
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section sits inside a highly structured, client-focused revenue dataset. The workbook uses scaled values (e.g., scale 1000) for large numbers in several blocks and includes a mix of segments (e.g., Corporate, Other) and a Grand Total row. This reflects a tailored P&L setup rather than a pristine, textbook format.

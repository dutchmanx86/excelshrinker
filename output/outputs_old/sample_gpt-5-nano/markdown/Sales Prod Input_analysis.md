## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Quota per Person
- **Section Type**: Inputs Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Captures monthly quotas per person across roles to inform target setting and performance planning.
- **Cell Range**: A3:P9
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: E1:P1
  - **Date Range**: 2021-01-31 to 2021-12-31
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Quota label header (A3)
  - Month-by-month quota values across the year (C5:P9, with partial spans such as C5, E5:P5; C6 with E6:P6; C7 with E7; F7:P7; C8 with E8; F8:P8; C9 with E9; F9:P9)
  - Monthly date series header (E1:P1)
- **Notes & Customizations**: Some quota cells are scaled by 1000 (e.g., F7:P7, F8:P8, F9:P9). The date series is defined via a monthly pattern (ds_1) starting 2021-01-31.

### Seasonality
- **Section Type**: Inputs Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Stores seasonality factors applied to all roles to adjust productivity/quotas across the year.
- **Cell Range**: A11:P13
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: E1:P1
  - **Date Range**: 2021-01-31 to 2021-12-31
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Seasonality label (A11)
  - All Roles label (A13)
  - Seasonality values across columns E13:P13
- **Notes & Customizations**: Represents a single row of monthly factors affecting all roles; aligned with the same monthly date series as the quota section.

### Productivity
- **Section Type**: Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Contains productivity metrics by role and month, used to measure output against quotas and guide performance assessment.
- **Cell Range**: A15:P21
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: E1:P1
  - **Date Range**: 2021-01-31 to 2021-12-31
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Productivity header (A15)
  - Month-by-month productivity values distributed across multiple rows/columns (e.g., C17, E17:P17, C18, E18:P18, C19, E19, F19:P19, etc., through C21, E21, F21:P21)
- **Notes & Customizations**: Layout spans multiple rows with selective column coverage; some metrics occupy partial column ranges (e.g., C- vs. E- to P- across different sub-rows), reflecting a multi-metric productivity view.

### Productivity (Adjusted for Seasonality)
- **Section Type**: Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Seasonality-adjusted productivity values intended to reflect normalized output across the year for comparability and planning.
- **Cell Range**: A23:P29
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: E1:P1
  - **Date Range**: 2021-01-31 to 2021-12-31
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Adjusted productivity header (A23)
  - Adjusted values across blocks: E25:P25, E26:P26, E27:F27:P27, E28:F28:P28, E29:F29:P29
- **Notes & Customizations**: Applies seasonality adjustments to the productivity metrics; data is spread across several sub-blocks with some cross-range column spans (e.g., F27:P27, F28:P28, F29:P29). Aligns with the same monthly date series as the other sections.

## 1. Spreadsheet Overview
- **Sheet Name**: CAC by Segment
- **Key Sections Identified**: CAC by Segment - Full Data Model (monthly CAC by segment with detailed cost components and upsell scenarios)

Notes:
- The sheet header indicates the company and model title: AlphaSense, Inc. (B1) and CAC by Segment (B2). The primary time-series spine is a monthly series defined from 2015-01-31 onward, spanning through 2027-12 (ds_1). The main data region appears to be a comprehensive, custom CAC by segment cost model with multiple cost drivers, segment breakdowns, and upsell scenarios.

## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### CAC by Segment - Full Data Model
- **Section Type**: Custom P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: This is the central, bespoke model used to analyze customer-acquisition-cost by segment. It consolidates base and Upsell cost drivers across multiple segments (e.g., Financial, Corporate, Account Manager categories, and sub-roles like AE and VP-driven lines), along with various cost components (wages, outsourced R&D, commissions, capitalized wages, support costs, etc.). The section is designed to support CAC calculation, cost allocation, and awareness of how different drivers impact CAC at the segment level, with accompanying percentage and dollar metrics to enable capacity planning and efficiency assessment.
- **Cell Range**: A5:FS140
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: T2:FS2
  - **Date Range**: 2015-01 to 2027-12
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Segment grouping and totals (e.g., Total Company, Financial, Corporate, Account Manager; sub-segments like AE - Financial, AE - Corporate, VP - Bus Dev, AE - Enterprise)
  - Cost drivers and allocations (Upsell Cost, Wages, Less: Wages, Less: Outsourced R&D, Less: Commission (Duplicative), Adjusted People Costs, All-In Support Costs)
  - Monitoring metrics (Total, % Financial, % Corporate, % to CAC, % to Upsell, $ to CAC, $ to Upsell)
  - Detailed wage and headcount related constructs (Total Wages, Product Specialist Salary, Capitalized Wages, Add: Capitalized Wages, Wages breakdown, and related ratios)
  - Support and people-related cost blocks (Support Cost, All-In Support Costs, Total Users)
  - Stage/build markers and scenario labels (e.g., 1 - Base - $25mm; Summary; Upsell Cost)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The model uses a wide, multi-block layout with numerous ranges across columns (e.g., G9:Q9, AR9:FS9, G10:Q10, AR10:FS10, etc.), many with a scaling factor of 1000 to present values in thousands.
  - It includes explicit scenario labeling and layout markers (e.g., A5 showing an "x" and A3/A71/A97-style markers) to delineate sections within the same sheet.
  - This is not a standard P&L; it is a bespoke CAC-by-segment cost model designed for detailed driver analysis, segment-specific budgeting, and upsell impact assessment.
  - The data structure supports both percentage and dollar-based CAC metrics, facilitating sensitivity and scenario planning across monthly periods.

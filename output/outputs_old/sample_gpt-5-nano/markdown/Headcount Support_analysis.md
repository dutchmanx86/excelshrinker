## 1. Spreadsheet Overview
- **Sheet Name**: Headcount Support
- **Key Sections Identified**:
  - Headcount Overview by Department (monthly time series with department/role granularity)
  - Quota & Role-based Headcount Allocation (role-level quotas and staffing data)

Note: The key sections reflect the sheet’s primary data organization: a department/Headcount matrix with a monthly date axis, and a separate, role-focused quota/staffing area. The data appears in a single sheet but is logically separated into a broad headcount view and a separate quota/role view.

## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Headcount Overview by Department
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section represents a consolidated, month-by-month headcount snapshot organized by department/function. It serves workforce planning and budget alignment by showing how many people are allocated per department over time, with an explicit 2020 Budget marker as context.
- **Cell Range**: A1:BW77
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: D1:CI1
  - **Date Range**: January 2015 to December 2021 (monthly series)
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Department labels along the left (e.g., department/functional group identifiers in column B)
  - A monthly data matrix across columns D through CI (date-aligned values)
  - A 2020 Budget context indicated in BW2
  - Additional rows for granular headcount by specific roles within the same structural area (e.g., rows 34–77)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Numeric values are scaled in thousands (many ranges show "scale": 1000)
  - The layout combines department-level headcount with role-level detail, indicating a customized workforce planning structure rather than a standard financial statement
  - The sheet is titled “Headcount Support,” emphasizing human-capital planning rather than pure financial accounting

### Quota & Role-based Headcount Allocation
- **Section Type**: Role-based Data Table (Quota / Staffing)
- **Description & Purpose**: This section houses role-specific headcount labels and quota figures. It complements the monthly headcount view by providing role-level staffing targets and quota metrics (e.g., sales roles and related quotas). This supports planning, compensation targeting, and performance expectations for GTM and related functions.
- **Cell Range**: B34:BW77
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: N/A (no explicit date axis is defined in this block)
  - **Date Range**: N/A
  - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**:
  - Role/Title labels starting in column B (e.g., Account Manager, Account Manager - Corp, Account Executive variants, SDR, Sales Ops, GTM roles, etc.)
  - Quota-related rows interspersed within the same area (e.g., Quota Sales Reps, AM - Financial (Quota), AE - Financial, AE - Corporate, AE - Enterprise, etc.)
  - Numeric blocks across the right side (various columns extending toward BW), with many cells using a 1000-scale convention
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - This section mixes role titles with quota values, indicating a tailored staffing/quota model rather than a standard, single-purpose table
  - The data includes a broad set of GTM and support roles, consistent with a customized headcount and quota planning framework
  - The presence of explicit role names (e.g., Account Manager, Account Manager - Corp, Account Executive variants, Sales Dev/Enablement, CRO, etc.) demonstrates detailed, role-level planning beyond a simple department headcount

Guidance on retrieval:
- For a broad headcount snapshot by department, use A1:BW77 as the retrieval range.
- For role-bound quotas and staffing details, use B34:BW77 as the retrieval range.
- The date axis for the time-series portion (monthly) is D1:CI1, covering 2015-01 to 2021-12, which can be used to align or slice the monthly headcount data within the first section.

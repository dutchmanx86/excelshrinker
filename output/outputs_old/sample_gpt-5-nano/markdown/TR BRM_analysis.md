## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Pricing & Tier Time-Series Data
- **Section Type**: Time-Series Data Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section captures tiered pricing information alongside monthly time-series values and an accompanying Mix indicator. It is designed to analyze revenue/volume by tier over time and to assess how mix shifts affect overall performance.
- **Cell Range**: D1:AB30
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: F1:W1
  - **Date Range**: January 2017 to June 2018
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Tier label (Tier), Pricing column, temporal data columns (Jan 17 through Jun 18), Mix column (Mix)
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section includes a dedicated Mix metric in the data layout, indicating a custom dimension for revenue/mix analysis beyond a standard flat P&L. The layout combines tier-level price data with multi-month time-series values.

### Global & Regional User Segmentation
- **Section Type**: Segmentation Data Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section consolidates user counts or usage metrics by segmentation buckets across global and regional scopes. It includes Global Users by bucket and Single Region buckets, enabling an audience- and region-centric view of usage or engagement.
- **Cell Range**: D2:Z43
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not time-series in the conventional sense (static segmentation view). If a time axis is implied, it would align with the same monthly headers used in the Pricing table, but the data presented here functions as categorical segmentation.
  - **Date Range**: N/A
  - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Global Users (1-10), Global Users (11-50), Global Users (51+), Single Region 1-10, Single Region 11-25, Single Region 26-50, Single Region 50+, plus related regional labels (e.g., Global research users, Single region users)
- **Notes & Customizations**: This section reflects a multi-bucket segmentation layout across multiple regions and groupings. It aggregates user-related metrics across different dimensional buckets rather than presenting a single time-series view.

### Corporate & Other Metrics
- **Section Type**: Summary Totals / Category Totals
- **Description & Purpose**: This section aggregates high-level category data for Corporate and Other groupings. It provides a concise view of totals or key metrics associated with these two broad categories.
- **Cell Range**: C9:D42
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not time-series (categorical totals). If interpreted as time-based, any axis would be external to this subset; the data itself is presented as category totals.
  - **Date Range**: N/A
  - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Corporate category, Other category (groupings), with related total cells in adjacent column(s)
- **Notes & Customizations**: The two-category layout (Corporate and Other) is presented as separate blocks rather than a continuous standard financial statement. This reflects a custom aggregation structure tailored to a specific reporting or dashboard need.

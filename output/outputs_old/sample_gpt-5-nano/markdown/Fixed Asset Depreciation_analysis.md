### Fixed Asset Depreciation Core Data Table
- **Section Type**: Custom Data Table (Depreciation Schedule Data)
- **Description & Purpose**: Centralized ledger of fixed-asset depreciation activity. This table tracks starting balances, currency conversions, and period-by-period depreciation values to support asset carrying amounts and depreciation expense calculations over time.
- **Cell Range**: A3:DU20
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not explicitly captured in the provided format ranges; the time-series structure is implied across the columns (C through DU) as per-period numeric data.
  - **Date Range**: Unknown (not explicitly provided in the extracted data)
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (typical for multi-period depreciation schedules; inferred from the wide column span C:DU)
- **Key Components**: Starting Balance, Conversion, Starting Balance (USD), per-period depreciation values, currency adjustments, asset-category blocks, and total aggregations
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Several numeric ranges use a scale of 1000, indicating thousands-based units in portions of the table.
  - Currency conversion is included (Starting Balance USD), enabling multi-currency tracking.
  - Asset-category grouping appears via category labels in column A (e.g., Oy, R&D) to structure rows into blocks.
  - The header block defines core columns:
    - B1: Account
    - C1: Starting Balance
    - D1: Conversion
    - E1: Starting Balance (USD)
  - Dictionary references identified and resolved for clarity:
    - LTD → A3 and A11
    - Mgmt → A4 and A12
    - Inc → A5 and A13
    - Total → A8 and A16

### Category Labels & Annotations
- **Section Type**: Metadata/Label Column
- **Description & Purpose**: Provides asset-category labels used to group the depreciation data into logical blocks. These labels help readers and downstream processes understand the segmentation (e.g., different asset types or business units) within the depreciation table.
- **Cell Range**: A6:A20
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: Not applicable (labels are static category descriptors)
  - **Date Range**: N/A
  - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Category labels such as:
  - A6: Oy
  - A7: Oy
  - A14: Oy
  - A15: Oy
  - A20: R&D
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The repeated use of the label "Oy" suggests a placeholder or a domain-specific tag; "R&D" appears explicitly as a distinct category.
  - This section is used to cluster rows within the core depreciation table for reporting and aggregation.

### Header Metadata
- **Section Type**: Header Row
- **Description & Purpose**: Defines the primary metadata and column labels that describe the data in the depreciation table. These headers establish the meaning of the values and how they should be interpreted in analysis and retrieval.
- **Cell Range**: B1:E1
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: N/A (header cells; not time-based labels)
  - **Date Range**: N/A
  - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Core column headers:
  - B1: Account
  - C1: Starting Balance
  - D1: Conversion
  - E1: Starting Balance (USD)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The header row explicitly labels the data columns used throughout the depreciation table, including a USD-converted balance for cross-currency analysis.
  - The layout suggests a two-tier balance presentation (local starting balance and USD starting balance) to support currency-aware reporting.

Notes on the data architecture (relevant to retrieval and interpretation)
- The sheet uses a single depreciation-focused data table (A3:DU20) that is supplemented by category labels (A6:A20) and a small header metadata block (B1:E1).
- Many numeric ranges are scaled (scale: 1000) in the format_ranges, indicating thousands-based units for portions of the data.
- The sheet appears designed for multi-period analysis across columns (C through DU), with per-period values aligned under the time-series-oriented columns, though explicit date labels are not captured in the provided ranges.
- The dictionary-like references in the inverted_index (LTD, Mgmt, Inc, Total) map to specific cells in the A-column region, useful for downstream lookups or validation steps when reconstructing labeled totals.

If you want, I can convert these sections into a machine-friendly lookup map (section name -> cell ranges) to plug into an AI data-retrieval routine.

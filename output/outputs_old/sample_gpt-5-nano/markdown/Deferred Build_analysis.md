### Deferred Revenue Detail & Summary
- **Section Type**: Balance Sheet
- **Description & Purpose**: This section represents the lifecycle and movement of deferred revenue, including beginning balances, additions (projected), revenue recognition, and ending balances. It also captures ARR-related context and how revenue is recognized over time, bridging balance sheet timing with revenue (P&L) impacts.
- **Cell Range**: A5:DV33
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: T2:FS2
  - **Date Range**: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12 (monthly)
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Deferred Beginning Balance; Add (Projected); Recognized as Revenue (Projected); Deferred Ending Balance; % of ARR; Revenue by components (Bookings Revenue Recognized; Renewal Revenue Recognized; Revenue from Deferred Revenue Balance); ARR context indicators.
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Uses a monthly date series defined as ds_1 (Monthly, start 2015-01-31, pattern Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2027-12).
  - Data spans across multiple non-contiguous blocks that are encompassed within the bounding range A5:DV33 (including headers and several related lines such as beginning/ending balances, ARR-related rows, and revenue recognition rows).
  - Scales numbers for readability (e.g., scale: 1000 on several ranges) and includes cross-block references (e.g., CJ columns and multiple date-aligned segments) to present a consolidated view of deferred revenue movements and recognition.

Notes on structure and context resolved from the data:
- The section anchors to a header date strip located at T2:FS2, aligned to a monthly series that runs from January 2015 through December 2027.
- The narrative aligns with typical deferred revenue accounting, combining balance-sheet balances (beginning/ending) with P&L impact (revenue recognized) and ARR related metrics to show how ARR progression relates to deferred revenue over time.

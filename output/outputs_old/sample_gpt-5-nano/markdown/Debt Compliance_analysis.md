- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: 
    - ds_1: N1:EC1

  - Covenant status flags (AO12:EC12 and related ranges)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The section blends a standard revenue view with covenant indicators, including multiple date axes to support different frequencies. There are explicit OK flags across the covenant/status grid, and a dedicated Growth Covenant label. Some ranges imply scaling in later blocks (e.g., cash/covenant figures across the same dates).

### EBITDA & Adjustments
- **Section Type**: P&L Adjustments
- **Description & Purpose**: Presents EBITDA along with common adjustments used to derive Adjusted EBITDA, highlighting key value drivers such as capitalized R&D and capitalized expenditures, and changes in deferred revenue. This supports a liquidity/operational health view that informs debt covenants and management’s profitability narrative.

  - Adjusted EBITDA (A28, C28, D28:L28, N28:EC28)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Several lines show a 1000x scale for certain ranges (e.g., D25:L25; D26:L26; O25:EC25; O26:EC26; etc.), indicating unit scaling for comparability. This section is designed to feed into covenant calculations and profitability frames with multiple frequency axes.

### Liquidity & Cash Position
- **Section Type**: Balance Sheet-like Liquidity Dashboard
- **Description & Purpose**: Centralized view of liquidity readiness and cash availability, including Remaining Months Liquidity (RML), Total Borrowings, Total Availability, Net Availability + Unrestricted Cash, and core liquidity metrics. This section serves as the cash/treasury backbone for debt covenants and liquidity planning.
- **Cell Range**: A15:EC44
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**:
    - ds_1: N1:EC1
    - ds_2: C2:L2
    - ds_3: N2:EC2
    - ds_4: C3:L3

    - ds_4: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Remaining Months Liquidity (RML) (A15)
  - Total Borrowings (A17; N17:EC17)
  - Total Availability (A18; AP18:EC18)
  - Net Availability + Unrestricted Cash (A22; AP22:EC22)
  - EBITDA-related liquidity measures (A24–A28 blocks) and related cross-checks
  - Liquidity Thresholds and labeled rows (A35, A39, A40, A42)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The section includes several scale-adjusted blocks (e.g., AP18:EC18 and AQ20:EC20 with scale 1000 in certain rows). It also contains a dedicated liquidity narrative around thresholds, including a typographical variation "Thershold" at A42, which likely reflects a layout customization. The row structure integrates both quantitative liquidity figures and qualitative threshold checks.

### Liquidity Buffers & Thresholds
- **Section Type**: Liquidity Buffer Summary
- **Description & Purpose**: Tracks dedicated liquidity buffers used to validate cushion levels and overall liquidity resilience. This includes a $5 million liquidity buffer, an RML liquidity buffer, and an Overall Liquidity Buffer that aggregates buffer components.
- **Cell Range**: A48:EC52

  - Overall Liquidity Buffer (A52)
  - Intervening buffers/linked ranges (AP50:BM50, BN50 scaled blocks, and AP52:EC52)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The buffers use explicit ranges and some scale factors to represent the buffer magnitudes across time. This section is designed to provide a concise, forward-looking liquidity cushion in conjunction with the main liquidity view.

Notes on time-series definitions and data organization
- The workbook uses multiple date-series definitions to support different frequencies in the same sheet:
  - ds_1: repeating_quarterly (3-month cadence, quarterly)
  - ds_2: annual (1-year cadence, annual)
  - ds_3: repeating_annual (annual cadence, repeated)
  - ds_4: monthly (1-month cadence, monthly)
- Date headers are located across non-contiguous blocks (e.g., N1:EC1 for ds_1; C2:L2 for ds_2; N2:EC2 for ds_3; C3:L3 for ds_4) and the corresponding data blocks live in the same columns, sometimes split across multiple column ranges within the same row (e.g., C7:L7 and N7:EC7 for Revenue). This layout enables parallel series in the same sheet.
- The sheet includes several explicit status/validation indicators (e.g., “OK” in many cells) and labeled sections (e.g., “Growth Covenant,” “Liquidity Threshold,” “Remaining Months Liquidity (RML)”) to facilitate quick checks and automated retrieval.

End of analysis. If you’d like, I can produce a compact, machine-friendly index mapping that assigns each section to a fixed location dictionary (section name -> cell range) for programmatic data retrieval.

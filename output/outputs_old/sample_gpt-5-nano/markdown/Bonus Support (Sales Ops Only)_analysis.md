## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Salary Budget & Departmental Allocation (Salary Budget Grid)
- **Section Type**: Custom Data Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section represents a department/role-based salary and budget matrix that is used for compensation planning and budgeting within Sales Ops. It aggregates department-level salary figures with monthly budget inputs, enabling scenario analysis and cost planning over time.
- **Cell Range**: D3:CX75
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: D1:CX1
  - **Date Range**: October 2019 through December 2027 (monthly series)
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Department/Team dimension (rows anchored by a Department column in the sheet; example department groupings include Content, Executive, Finance & Admin, Marketing, Product, Engineering—both overall and by geography such as Engineering (India) and Engineering (ex India)—and Sales with related sales roles)
  - Salary line item (A2 indicates the general Salary label, with row-wise department data in the grid)
  - Budget inputs for years (e.g., 2019 Budget in D2 and 2020 Budget in R2)
  - Monthly budget/allocation cells spanning D3:CX75
  - An explicit Adjustment row/area (e.g., row around B12) that affects the grid
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Data is presented in thousands (scale annotations indicate thousands throughout the numeric blocks)
  - This sheet is explicitly labeled for Sales Ops, indicating a non-standard, department-focused budgeting view rather than a traditional financial statement
  - There are dual time-series axes used elsewhere on the sheet (ds_1 for the main budget timeline, ds_2 later used for bonus-related data)

- Time-series references resolved from the dictionary:
  - ds_1: Monthly series from 2019-10 to 2027-12, used for the main budget/date grid (Dates Location D1:CX1)

- Departmental context (examples of actual values represented by the dictionary mapping):
  - Content, Executive, Finance & Admin, Marketing, Product, Engineering (ex India), Engineering (India), Sales, and Sales Ops-related roles (e.g., CRO, Sales Manager, SDR Manager, SDR, CS Manager, AM – Corporate, AM – Financial, PS Manager, Product Specialist, Enablement Manager, Sales Admin, Sales Operations Manager, Sales Operations, GTM Strategy)

### Bonus Calculations & Attainment (Bonus Components & Metrics)
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section consolidates bonus-related components and performance metrics. It includes the Total Sales Bonus and Quarterly Sales Bonus lines, along with attainment statistics (Average Bonus Attainment) across the same monthly horizon. The section supports tracking, reconciliation, and performance-based payout planning for the Sales Ops function.
- **Cell Range**: F36:CX75
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: F61:CX61
  - **Date Range**: December 2019 through December 2027 (monthly series)

  - Average Bonus Attainment metrics (e.g., “AVERAGE BONUS ATTAINMENT” block)
  - Monthly bonus figures across the range F36:CX75 (scaled data in thousands)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - A secondary date axis ds_2 is employed for the bonus data (F61:CX61), indicating a separate monthly alignment for bonus-related metrics compared to the main budget timeline
  - The layout uses a thousands scale for numeric values and spans a broad column range from F to CX to accommodate many monthly periods
  - This section sits atop and alongside the main budget grid, offering a consolidated view of bonus expectations versus attainment

- Time-series references resolved from the dictionary:
  - ds_2: Monthly series from 2019-12 to 2027-12, used for the bonus data timeline (Dates Location F61:CX61)

- Section-level context (examples of actual values represented by the dictionary mappings):
  - Bonus-related components, including Total Sales Bonus, Quarterly Sales Bonus, and various monthly attainment figures, are tracked alongside the broader department salary/budget data in the same Sales Ops context

Additional contextual notes
- Date axis definitions in the data capture:
  - ds_1 (monthly, 2019-10 to 2027-12) powers the main budget/date grid (D1:CX1)
  - ds_2 (monthly, 2019-12 to 2027-12) powers the bonus-focused date axis (F61:CX61)
- The sheet’s layout and naming clearly indicate a Sales Ops-focused budgeting and bonus-tracking dataset, with department-level salary inputs, budget imports for 2019 and 2020, an adjustment field, and a substantial bonus/attainment module that feeds into a longer monthly horizon.

## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Scenario Data Tables
- **Section Type**: Scenario Grid (Custom Data Matrix)
- **Description & Purpose**: Centralized, multi-scenario data grid that enumerates four scenario lines (Base - $25mm, Growth - $25mm, Base - $50mm, Base - $50mm (R&D)) and their associated numeric values across multiple periods. This section provides the structural backbone for comparing financial outcomes under different scale assumptions and R&D intensity, enabling quick retrieval of a given scenario’s data for a given time horizon.
- **Cell Range**: B14:CA188
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**:
    - ds_1 (Annual): E6:Q6
    - ds_2 (Annual repeating): T6:FS6
    - ds_3 (Monthly): T8:FS8
  - **Date Range**:
    - ds_1: 2015-01-01 to 2027-01-01
    - ds_2: 2015-01-01 to 2027-01-01
    - ds_3: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12-31
  - **Frequency**:
    - ds_1: Annual
    - ds_2: Annual
    - ds_3: Monthly
- **Key Components**: The four primary scenario blocks:
  - Base - $25mm
  - Growth - $25mm
  - Base - $50mm
  - Base - $50mm (R&D)
- **Notes & Customizations**: This is a highly customized, CTRL-style data grid designed for scenario analysis. It relies on multiple date-series headers and uses mapped ranges across different columns to present year-by-year and month-by-month data for each scenario. The sheet’s structure supports quick retrieval of scenario-specific values by cell range.

### Balance Sheet & Working Capital Inputs
- **Section Type**: Balance Sheet Inputs
- **Description & Purpose**: Consolidates balance sheet support items and working capital metrics that feed into cash flow and P&L modelling. This section captures key operating-cycle components (DSO, prepaid expenses, capital expenditures as a percent of revenue, payables metrics, accrued items, and other balance-sheet related assumptions) used to drive liquidity and cost calculations.
- **Cell Range**: A11:FS188
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**:
    - ds_1 (Annual): E6:Q6
    - ds_2 (Annual repeating): T6:FS6
    - ds_3 (Monthly): T8:FS8
  - **Date Range**:
    - ds_1: 2015-01-01 to 2027-01-01
    - ds_2: 2015-01-01 to 2027-01-01
    - ds_3: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12-31
  - **Frequency**:
    - ds_1: Annual
    - ds_2: Annual
    - ds_3: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Major balance sheet and working-capital categories such as:
  - Balance Sheet Support
  - Days Sales Outstanding
  - Prepaid Expenses (Monthly % of OpEx)
  - Capital Expenditures – % of Revenue
  - Accounts Payable Days Payable Outstanding
  - Commissions Payable – % of ARR
  - Accrued Expenses Days Payable Outstanding
  - Accrued Commissions – % of ARR
  - Accrued Wages – % Growth
  - Tekes (various project codes)
  - LIBOR
  - Payroll Taxes Payable – % Growth
  - Sales Taxes Payable – % of Revenue
  - Deferred Commissions Growth
  - Various Tekes and cash-related lines
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section includes a broad mix of numeric blocks, percentage-based lines, and periodic scaling (e.g., some ranges use scale 1000). It’s a customized balance sheet/working-capital construct designed to feed downstream cash flow and cost calculations.

### Financing & Cash Metrics
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table (Financing & Cash)
- **Description & Purpose**: Aggregates financing and liquidity metrics such as interest rates, cash-account experience, and commission-related financing items. This section is intended to capture cost of capital, cash position dynamics, and related administrative fees and ratios that influence cash planning and profitability.
- **Cell Range**: I139:FS188
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**:
    - ds_1 (Annual): E6:Q6
    - ds_2 (Annual repeating): T6:FS6
    - ds_3 (Monthly): T8:FS8
  - **Date Range**:
    - ds_1: 2015-01-01 to 2027-01-01
    - ds_2: 2015-01-01 to 2027-01-01
    - ds_3: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12-31
  - **Frequency**:
    - ds_1: Annual
    - ds_2: Annual
    - ds_3: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Core financing/cash metrics such as:
  - Interest Rate
  - Interest Rate - Admin Fee
  - Interest Rate on Cash Account
  - Percent of Cash in Account
  - Effective Commission Rate
  - Tekes project lines and other financing-related figures
  - Various Year-Monthly data blocks (scaled values where indicated)
- **Notes & Customizations**: This area includes multiple financing and cash-flow related metrics with several blocks labeled by rows (e.g., Tekes lines, LIBOR, admin fees) and uses a mix of plain numbers and scaled values. It is a customized appendix to the core balance sheet model, enabling detailed cost and liquidity analyses.

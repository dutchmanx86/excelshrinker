### Executive Operating Expenses Summary
- **Section Type**: Custom P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: A consolidated view of executive-related operating costs, broken out into major cost blocks and numerous subcategories. The section is designed to support monthly tracking of executive spend and to provide a granular breakdown of personnel costs, benefits, travel, marketing, admin, and other operating expenses associated with executives. It functions as a bespoke, company-specific P&L-style expense ledger for executive-related activities.
- **Cell Range**: A5:Q398
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: T2:FS2 (row 2 across the top contains the monthly date labels)
  - **Date Range**: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12 (monthly series)
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Major sub-blocks defining the structure (high-level, not every label):
  - Total Executive Expense (and subcategories under executive headcount)
  - Executive People Costs (Wages, Executive Wages, Executive Salaries Working Abroad, Holiday Pay, Sick Leave, Bonuses, Benefits, Payroll Taxes, etc.)
  - Non-Personnel Operating Expenses (travel, telecom, internet, home office, memberships, subscriptions, office-related costs, etc.)
  - Capitalized Costs and Outsourced R&D (including capitalized wages and R&D-related items)
  - General & Admin and Corporate Overhead areas (insurance, professional services, audit/tax, bank fees, etc.)
  - Marketing, IT/Data Services, and other support functions (advertising, data feeds, software, hardware, etc.)
  - Miscellaneous and Other Costs (legal, penalties, bad debt, etc.)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Many numeric cells are scaled by 1000 (values represent thousands).
  - The section is heavily “Executive” focused, with a multitude of sub-items under executive costs and related admin/overhead allocations.
  - The layout uses a consistent left-column labeling scheme (e.g., “Wages,” “Executive Wages,” “Travel Costs,” “Total Executive Travel Costs,” “Total Executive Other Costs”) and a wide monthly data range across I:Q (and beyond) to capture time series data.
  - There are placeholder or structural markers (e.g., A5, A9, A12 with “x”) that organize the section visually but do not carry financial values themselves.
  - The section integrates a formal dictionary-driven structure for cost categories (e.g., “Headcount,” “Cost Per Head,” “% of Wages”) as reference points for detailed breakdowns, indicating the model supports ratio-based metrics in addition to absolute costs.

### Date Series Definition (Monthly)
- **Section Type**: Data Table / Time Series Definition
- **Description & Purpose**: Defines the primary time axis used by the dataset. This section provides a monthly date series that anchors all time-based data in the sheet, enabling consistent period-over-period analysis and alignment with the data rows for each month.
- **Cell Range**: T2:FS2
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: T2:FS2
  - **Date Range**: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Primary time-series element ds_1 (monthly series) with pattern “Monthly series from 2015-01 to 2027-12”
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The monthly series is defined in the date_series_definitions as ds_1, with a start date of 2015-01-31 and a pattern covering through 2027-12.
  - The date labels in T2:FS2 are used as the column headers for the entire data block in A5:Q398, aligning each month with the corresponding row of expense values.

### Filings Category Time Series (Monthly)
- **Section Type**: Custom Time-Series Data Table
- **Description & Purpose**: A category-level, monthly time-series matrix that tracks amounts by category across a chronological header. The sheet structure is designed to summarize monthly figures for each category and view a totals row by month.
- **Cell Range**: B1:S7
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: B1:S1
  - **Date Range**: 2017-01 to 2018-06
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Date header row (B1:S1)
  - Category labels (A3, A4, A6) corresponding to rows with data (Other, Corporate, Broker Partner)
  - Totals/summary row by month (Row 2)
  - Category data blocks spanning monthly columns (B-K, L-N with thousand-scale, and O-S)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Some category blocks apply a thousand-scale multiplier (L3:N3, L4:N4, L6:N6), indicating values are in thousands.
  - A5 is empty, suggesting a potential missing category label for that row.
  - The layout is a bespoke, multi-block time-series table rather than a standard P&L or balance-sheet-style display.

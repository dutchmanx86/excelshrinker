## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Corporate Revenue & KPI Matrix
- **Section Type**: Custom Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section aggregates corporate-revenue related metrics and KPI data over a monthly time series, enabling performance tracking and aggregation into a total. It is arranged as a matrix with header labels and multiple sub-blocks, some of which are scaled for readability.
- **Cell Range**: D10:DS25
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: C1:DS1
  - **Date Range**: 2010-10 to 2020-10
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Primary header labels anchored around Corp / Corporate / Total (top-level section anchors include the labels “Corp” at A9, “Corporate” at A23, and “Total” at A25).
  - Data blocks across rows 10–19 and 23–25 with multiple column ranges (including ranges that are scaled by 1000 in portions of the matrix).
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Uses a mix of broad column ranges (e.g., D10, E10:CY10, CZ10:DS10, etc.) to build a comprehensive corporate metrics matrix.
  - Several data blocks are explicitly scaled by 1000 for readability in the output (as indicated by the format_ranges).

### Churned CARR - Lost Clients
- **Section Type**: KPI / Churn Data Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section captures the impact of churn in terms of CARR loss and lost clients, aligned to the same monthly timeline as the corporate metrics to support comparative analysis and trend assessment.
- **Cell Range**: D22:DD22
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: C1:DS1
  - **Date Range**: 2010-10 to 2020-10
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - The section is explicitly labeled in the sheet as “Churned CARR - Lost Clients” (A21).
  - Data resides on row 22 across the time-aligned columns (D22:DD22), representing churn-related figures in the same period framework as the corporate data.
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Directly tied to the same date axis as the Corporate Revenue matrix to enable straightforward cross-section analysis.

### Corporate Totals & Summary
- **Section Type**: Summary Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section provides the summarized corporate totals and a distinct corporate total line, serving as a consolidated view across the same monthly time horizon. It anchors the end-user’s view of overall corporate performance.
- **Cell Range**: D23:DD25
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: C1:DS1
  - **Date Range**: 2010-10 to 2020-10
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Row anchors include the label “Corporate” (A23) and a subsequent “Total” line (A25).
  - Data spans rows 23–25 and columns D–DD, representing monthly totals and sub-totals.
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - Some data blocks in this area are scaled by 1000 (e.g., F23:DD23 and E25:DD25) consistent with the matrix’ approach to readability.
  - This section forms the concluding accumulation of the corporate dataset within the sheet’s structure.

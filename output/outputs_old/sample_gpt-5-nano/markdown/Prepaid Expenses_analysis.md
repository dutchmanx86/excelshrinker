## 1. Spreadsheet Overview
- **Sheet Name**: Prepaid Expenses
- **Key Sections Identified**:
  - Time Dimension & Growth Rate (time axis and growth control that drive the per-vendor prepaid data)
  - Prepaid Expenses Data by Vendor (vendor-level prepaid amounts across a monthly time grid, including multi-currency totals)

## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Time Dimension & Growth Rate
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section provides the time-axis framework and a growth-rate control that govern how prepaid expense data is interpreted over time. It anchors the monthly data series and allows for scenario/scaling adjustments via a growth rate parameter.
- **Cell Range**: B1:Z2
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: C2:Z2
  - **Date Range**: 2020-01 to 2021-12
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Growth rate control (B1) and monthly date headers (C2:Z2)
  - Top-row growth-rate values across D1:Z1
  - The monthly series metadata is linked to the date_series_definitions ds_1 (Monthly series from 2020-01 to 2021-12)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The date series is defined as monthly with a start date of 2020-01-01 and pattern aligned to 2020-01 through 2021-12.
  - This section is not a financial statement on its own; it provides the temporal context for the prepaid data that follows.

### Prepaid Expenses Data by Vendor
- **Section Type**: Custom Data Table (Prepaid Expenses Schedule)
- **Description & Purpose**: This section tracks prepaid expenses by vendor across the monthly time grid, capturing unit pricing context, vendor-specific prepaid amounts, and currency-level totals. It serves as the primary data reservoir for prepaid costs by vendor, including multi-currency totals (e.g., INR, Euro, USD) for end-of-period summaries.
- **Cell Range**: A3:Z81
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: C2:Z2
  - **Date Range**: 2020-01 to 2021-12
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**:
  - Vendors list (B4:B81) with individual vendor rows
  - Header trio: Unit Price (A3), Vendors (B3), Amount (C3)
  - Monthly/prepaid amounts spread across columns D through Z (alignment with the date headers)
  - Currency-specific totals and summaries located in the lower-right region (e.g., INR totals, Euro totals, USD totals in respective rows/columns such as C74:Z81 and related total labels)
- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The sheet includes multi-currency totals and explicit currency labels (e.g., INR, Euro, USD) for prepaid totals (e.g., "Total Prepaids (USD)", "Total Oy Prepaids (EURO)"), indicating a deliberate multi-currency handling approach.
  - The vendor list spans multiple rows starting at B4 and continues downward (e.g., Outreach Corporation, Salesforce.com Inc., HackerRank, Rekener, Inc., etc.), with each vendor occupying a block of rows. The inverted index provides exact vendor-to-range mappings for reference, but the practical retrieval target is the A3:Z81 data block.
  - The section is designed to support monthly aggregation via the ds_1 monthly date series and to provide totals across currencies for currency-aware prepaid accounting.

Additional context from the data definitions (for reference in future retrieval):
- Date series definition ds_1 specifies a monthly cadence, starting 2020-01-01, described as "Monthly series from 2020-01 to 2021-12." This confirms the intended time horizon and frequency used in this sheet.
- The sections rely on a combined structure of time-axis headers (C2:Z2), growth rate control (B1, D1:Z1), and a vendor-centric data region (A3:Z81) with currency totals clustered toward the lower part of the range.

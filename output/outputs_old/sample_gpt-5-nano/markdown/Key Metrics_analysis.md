### Key Metrics Dashboard
- **Section Type**: KPI Dashboard / Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: A consolidated hub that presents historical and forecasted financial and SaaS metrics. The section aggregates revenue mechanics (ARR, Annual Subscription Value, new business, upsells), churn and retention indicators, customer/count metrics, and several ARPU- and renewal-focused indicators. It is designed to enable quick evaluation of company health, growth drivers, and churn impact across multiple time horizons.
- **Cell Range**: A4:AU499
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: I1:BV1
  - **Date Range**: 2015 History through Sales Plan (covering historical periods and the plan/forecast period)
  - **Frequency**: Mixed (historical annual history blocks plus forecast/plan data; multiple date anchors within the range)
- **Key Components**: 
  - Annual / subscription value metrics (e.g., Annual Subscription Value)
  - ARR and related subscription metrics (e.g., ARR Added, New Contracts, Average/Weighted contract length)
  - Revenue mix and growth indicators (e.g., New Sales, Upsells, Upsells as % of Total, Increases)
  - Churn & retention metrics (e.g., ARR Churn, Uncontrollable vs. Controllable churn, Net/Total churn metrics)
  - SaaS performance metrics (e.g., SaaS Metrics blocks)
  - Renewal Opportunities and renewal-related checks and counts
  - Customer and user metrics (client firms, user bases, ARPU)
  - Raw data and renewal opportunity data sections for deeper drill-downs
- **Notes & Customizations**: 
  - The layout appears to be a unified KPI dashboard that blends historical history with forward-looking plan data (Sales Plan) across multiple metrics and dimensions. 
  - The sheet combines a wide set of metrics with extensive cross-column coverage (e.g., C4:BB4, BC4:BT4, BV4:CG4, etc.), indicating a multi-portfolio or multi-segment analysis. 
  - Several sections include labeled subsections (e.g., ARR, New Contracts, Churn, Renewal Opportunities) but the overall structure is an integrated dashboard rather than a single standard P&L or cash-flow view. 
  - Some blocks reference detailed breakdowns (e.g., Churn by controllable vs. uncontrollable, renewal opportunities by count and value) and include both historical and forecasted ranges.

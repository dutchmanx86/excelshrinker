## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Retention Metrics Dashboard
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section aggregates the core retention and renewal indicators used to monitor customer health and forecast renewal revenue. It combines churn metrics, blended retention, and renewal outcomes across multiple segments and time periods, forming the primary dashboard surface for retention performance.
- **Cell Range**: A5:FS85
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: T2:FS2
  - **Date Range**: 2015-01-31 to 2027-12 (monthly series)
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Churn-related metrics (e.g., Churn, Total Churn)
  - Retention metrics (e.g., Blended Retention %)
  - Renewal-related data by segment (e.g., Up for Renewal, Annual Up for Renewal, Total Corporate Up for Renewal, Total Other Up for Renewal)
  - Renewal outcomes (Renewal - Won, Renewal - Lost), Pending Cancel, Still Open in Previous Month, Renewal (default)
  - Associated sub-blocks by monthly/annual layout and segmented categories (Corporate, Financial, Other, etc.)
  - New bookings and renewal-related aggregates (e.g., New Bookings, Previous Renewal)
- **Notes & Customizations**: 
  - The section appears to serve as a scenario-driven retention dashboard; a base scenario is indicated by B3 with the label “1 - Base - $25mm,” signaling a baseline assumption used in projections.
  - Data is variably scaled (many numeric blocks have a scale of 1000, implying values are in thousands).
  - The sheet header includes explicit identifiers such as “Retention Summary,” “Churn,” and “Total Churn,” along with a hierarchy of renewal categories (Annual vs. Total, Corporate vs. Other) to support multi-path renewal forecasting.
  - The sheet is anchored to a company context, with the top-left value “AlphaSense, Inc.” in B1, and uses a formal date-series definition (monthly ds_1) for the time axis.

### Income Statement
- **Section Type**: Custom P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: A condensed, category-level monthly income statement-style view intended to track financial performance across time by predefined categories. The layout presents monthly columns and a small set of category rows, suitable for quick variance or trend analysis rather than a full GAAP P&L.
- **Cell Range**: A5:S9
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: B3:S3
  - **Date Range**: January 2017 through June 2018 (monthly series)
    - Specific start: 2017-01-31
    - Specific end: 2018-06-30
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: 
  - Monthly columns (Feb 2017 through Jun 2018 as header labels in the adjacent header rows)
  - Primary categories (e.g., Corporate, Other)
  - Supporting rows that likely represent subtotals or adjustments (e.g., numeric blocks in the rows above/below the main category rows)
- **Notes & Customizations**: 
  - This is a bespoke layout rather than a standard standard-format P&L; it emphasizes category-level totals across a monthly horizon.
  - The sheet uses a two-category structure (Corporate, Other) with associated monthly values, and includes additional numeric rows that may serve as sub-totals or adjustments.
  - Dates are defined via a monthly series (ds_1) with a pattern covering 2017-01 to 2018-06, and the date values live in B3:S3.

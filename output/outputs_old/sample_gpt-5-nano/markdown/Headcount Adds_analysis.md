## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Raw Hire Data Table
- **Section Type**: Standard Data Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Central transactional dataset recording each hire with employee attributes and a monthly headcount spread across a date axis. Used to track onboarding activity and monthly headcount evolution by employee entry.
- **Cell Range**: A1:U71
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: I1:U1
  - **Date Range**: 2019-12 to 2020-12
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: Core employee fields (Department, Type, Employee Name, Title, Office, Hire Date) plus a monthly data grid spanning I1:U1 to capture month-by-month values per row.
- **Notes & Customizations**: Structured as a Hire Data table with a broad monthly axis; includes a secondary date-series reference (ds_2) in the data definitions, but the primary, date-driven view is the I1:U1 axis. Some columns (G, H) may be unused in the layout.

### Monthly Headcount Summary (Counts)
- **Section Type**: Summary Table
- **Description & Purpose**: Aggregated view of headcount additions by month, labeled with a header "Counts" and populated across the monthly axis. Serves as a quick KPI-like summary derived from the raw hire data.
- **Cell Range**: A74:U99
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - **Dates Location**: I1:U1
  - **Date Range**: 2019-12 to 2020-12
  - **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Key Components**: A header row (Counts) and a block of per-month count values aligned with the monthly axis (I75:U75 and surrounding rows up to U99).
- **Notes & Customizations**: This section reuses the same monthly axis as the raw data; it functions as a straightforward counts summary rather than a full dashboard. It sits visually below the raw data, providing a concise monthly totals view.

### Date Series Definitions
- **Section Type**: Time Series Definition
- **Description & Purpose**: Defines the date axes used by the sheetâ€™s data matrix. Includes a primary monthly axis (ds_1) and a secondary, unordered date series (ds_2) used for additional dimension mapping in the data import.
- **Cell Range**:
  - ds_1 axis header dates: I1:U1
  - ds_2 date axis: F2:F71
- **Time Series Horizon**:
  - For ds_1:
    - **Dates Location**: I1:U1
    - **Date Range**: 2019-12 to 2020-12
    - **Frequency**: Monthly
  - For ds_2:
    - **Dates Location**: F2:F71
    - **Date Range**: 2020-01-01 to 2021-04-01
    - **Frequency**: Unordered/Custom (8 points)
- **Key Components**: ds_1 monthly axis (I1:U1) and ds_2 unordered date axis (F2:F71) that underpin alternate mappings in the data structure.
- **Notes & Customizations**: ds_2 is labeled as an unordered column series to accommodate non-sequential dates; ds_1 follows a standard monthly progression. This section captures how time is anchored in the data, separate from the main raw table.

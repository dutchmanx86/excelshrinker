- **Notes & Customizations**:
  - The data appears to be a customized P&L with detailed line-item breakdowns for revenue streams and expense categories.
  - Numeric values are scaled by 1000 in many lines (format shows scale: 1000 for most numeric ranges).
  - There is indentation in the labels to convey hierarchical structure (e.g., "      PRM Global", "        Wages", etc.).
  - Several lines labeled as “Total Revenue,” “Total Cost of Sales,” and related totals suggest multiple grouping levels or formatting separators rather than separate, independent sections.
  - The sheet is titled “OpEx - Sales,” indicating this P&L focuses on operating expenditures in a sales context, but it includes revenue lines and full P&L mechanics (not just OpEx). This implies a blended or customized P&L intended for management reporting and planning within a sales-focused scope.

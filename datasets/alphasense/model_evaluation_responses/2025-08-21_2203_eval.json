        "generated_answer_full": "The revenue forecast is built up from a bottoms-up projection of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), which is then converted to recognized revenue. The model forecasts ARR using two primary methods: a sales productivity model and a user growth model. The sales productivity model projects new bookings and upsells by applying assumptions for sales quotas, productivity percentages, and seasonality to different sales roles (Account Executive, Account Manager, VP). The user growth model projects the number of users, segmented by Corporate and Financial clients, and applies an ARR/User assumption to derive ARR. These ARR additions feed a deferred revenue waterfall, and recognized revenue is calculated by applying a \"Rev % of MRR\" ratio to the recurring revenue base for each client segment.\n\nThe most important drivers are sales quotas, sales productivity, and user growth. Key drivers include:\n- Annual quotas for sales roles, such as the Account Executive - Financial quota set at $630,000 for 2021-2027 in the Base scenario.\n- Productivity as a percentage of quota, with a forecast assumption of 85% for most sales roles from 2021 onwards.\n- The mix of new bookings versus upsell, where new bookings for AEs are forecast to decline from 46% to 22% of their contribution, while upsells increase.\n- The \"Rev % of MRR\" ratio, used to convert MRR to GAAP revenue, is forecasted at a flat 97.9% for Financial and 95.2% for Corporate clients.\n- User growth, which is broken down by Corporate and Financial segments and further by industry verticals.\n\nForecast assumptions are simplified compared to historical actuals. For example, the Account Executive - Financial quota is forecasted at a flat $630,000 annually from 2021, whereas historical 2020 quotas annualized to approximately $585,000. Sales productivity is forecasted at a flat 85% for AEs, while historical monthly productivity in 2020 fluctuated between approximately 54% and 123%. Similarly, the \"Rev % of MRR\" ratio is forecasted as a flat percentage (e.g., 97.9% for Financial), while historical data from 2020 shows significant monthly volatility for this metric, ranging from 86% to 101%.",

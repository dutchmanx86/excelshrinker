## 2. Detailed Section Analysis

### Utilization Summary
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section summarizes the utilization of assets (presumably chassis) across different categories (Street-MH, Street-EVG, Terminal). It provides key metrics like utilization rates and percentages.
- **Cell Range**: C5:Q13
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: C5:C13
    - **Column Headers Location**: G6:Q6 (Implied years, but not explicitly labeled)
    - **Data Range**: G7:Q13
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: Implied years, but not explicitly labeled. Assuming 2015 to 2021 based on the number of columns.
    - **Frequency**: Annual
- **Key Components**: Net Lease Billed Days, Terminal, Grand Total, % of Street - MH, % of Street - EVG, % of Total - Terminal, Utilization Rate.
- **Notes & Customizations**: Utilization metrics are calculated for different categories of assets.

### Revenue & Cost Analysis
- **Section Type**: Custom P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: This section analyzes revenue and costs associated with chassis usage, breaking down revenue by source (Trucker Street, Net Lease, Terminal) and costs by type (M&R, Admin, Repo, etc.). It calculates revenue, costs, and per-day metrics.
- **Cell Range**: B16:Q79
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: B17:B79 and C19, C24, C25, C29, C33, C37, C41, C42, C43, C57:C63, C77, C78
    - **Column Headers Location**: H16:Q16 (Implied years, but not explicitly labeled)
    - **Data Range**:
      - Annual data: H17:Q79
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: Implied years, but not explicitly labeled. Assuming 2015 to 2021 based on the number of columns.
    - **Frequency**: Annual
- **Key Components**: Revenue, EVG Street Costs, Terminal Billings, M&R Cost, Admin Expense, Repo Expense, EBITDA, EBITDA per Usage Day, EBITDA Margin (%).
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section includes calculations for per-usage-day costs and revenue.

### Chassis Acquisition Analysis
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section analyzes the costs associated with acquiring chassis, including the purchase price, reconditioning costs, and other related expenses. It calculates the total effective purchase price and related metrics.
- **Cell Range**: B82:G100
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: B83:B100
    - **Column Headers Location**: G82
    - **Data Range**: G83:G100
- **Time Series Details**: This section does NOT contain a time series. It represents a one-time analysis.
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Chassis to be Acquired, Price per Chassis, Payment to EVG, Total Chassis Price, Reconditioning Costs, Total Effective Purchase Price.
- **Notes & Customizations**: This section focuses on upfront costs associated with acquiring chassis.

### Cash Flow Projections
- **Section Type**: Standard P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: This section projects cash flows based on a depreciated value exit and a Total Enterprise Value (TEV) exit. It calculates key metrics like Unlevered IRR and NPV.
- **Cell Range**: B104:Q136
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: B105:B117, B119, B121, B123, B125:B134, B136
    - **Column Headers Location**: G6:Q6 (Implied years, but not explicitly labeled)
    - **Data Range**:
      - Annual data (Depreciated Value Exit): H108:Q115
      - Annual data (Total Enterprise Value Exit): H125:L132
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**:
      - Depreciated Value Exit: Implied years, but not explicitly labeled. Assuming 2015 to 2021 based on the number of columns.
      - TEV Exit: Implied years, but not explicitly labeled. Assuming 2015 to 2019 based on the number of columns.
    - **Frequency**: Annual
- **Key Components**: EBITDA, Investment, Accelerated Depreciation, EBIT, Cash Taxes @, Cash Income, WC Investment @, Capex, Cash Flow, Total Cash Flows, Unlevered IRR.
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section includes two different exit scenarios (depreciated value and TEV), each with its own set of cash flow projections.

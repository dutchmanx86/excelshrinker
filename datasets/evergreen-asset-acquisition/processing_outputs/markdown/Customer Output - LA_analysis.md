## 1. **Sheet Name**: (Sheet name is not provided in the JSON, assuming it is "Sheet1")

### Section Name: Chassis Purchase Options Analysis
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section summarizes different options for purchasing chassis, likely for EVG (Electric Vehicle Group) usage. It presents purchase prices, potential MH (Market Housing?) percentages, CH (Chassis Housing?) rates, and terminal rates for each option. The purpose is to compare the financial implications of various chassis acquisition strategies.
- **Cell Range**: B13:G33
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: B14:B33 (e.g., different chassis purchase options)
    - **Column Headers Location**: C13:G13 (Purchase Price per Chassis, Total Purchase Price, MH %, CH Rate, Terminal Rate)
    - **Data Range**:
      - C14:G33 (numeric values and percentages for each option)
- **Time Series Details**:
    - There is no explicit time series in this section. It appears to be a static comparison of different purchase options at a single point in time.
- **Key Components**: Purchase Price per Chassis, Total Purchase Price, MH %, CH Rate, Terminal Rate.
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section includes assumptions (C5:C10) that are critical for understanding the context and limitations of the analysis. The MH and CH abbreviations are not explicitly defined, but context suggests they relate to different types of chassis usage or billing. The formatting suggests that some values may be negative (red formatting).

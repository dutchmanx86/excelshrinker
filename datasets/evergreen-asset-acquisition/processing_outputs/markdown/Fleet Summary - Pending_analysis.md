### Chassis Valuation Analysis
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section calculates and displays the depreciated value of chassis assets based on their age and purchase price. It provides insights into the current book value and projected depreciated value after a specified number of years.
- **Cell Range**: B5:M13
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: B5:B8, B10:B13
    - **Column Headers Location**: B11:M11
    - **Data Range**:
      - C5:C7 (Value New, Residual Value, Useful Life)
      - D10, D12:D13 (ASI/CSG, Age)
      - E12:F13 (Count, % of Total)
      - G12:I13 (Book Value Per, Purchase Per, Total Purchase)
      - K12:M13 (Age 10 years Later, Depreciated 10 year value per, Depreciated 10 year value total)
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: Not explicitly a time series, but "Age" in D11 and K11 implies a time-dependent calculation. The "10 Years Later" in K11 suggests a single point in the future relative to the "Age" in D11.
    - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Value New, Residual Value, Useful Life, Age, Count, % of Total, Book Value Per, Purchase Per, Total Purchase, Depreciated 10 year value per, Depreciated 10 year value total.
- **Notes & Customizations**: The calculation projects the depreciated value 10 years into the future. The formatting of the "Value New" and "Residual Value" fields (C5, C6) is distinct, indicating potential emphasis or a specific data source.

### Chassis Age Distribution
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section shows the distribution of chassis by age.
- **Cell Range**: B16:C38
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: B16, B18:B38
    - **Column Headers Location**: B18, C18
    - **Data Range**:
      - C19:C38
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: B20:B38 contains age in "Years", implying a time series. The specific years are not provided in the JSON extract.
    - **Frequency**: Annual
- **Key Components**: Age, Book Value
- **Notes & Customizations**: The values in column B are formatted as "# \"Years\"", indicating the age of the chassis.

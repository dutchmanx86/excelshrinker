    - **Data Range**:
      - Annual data: G7:Q12
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: The data in G6:Q6 is not explicitly labeled with dates, but the context suggests an annual time series. Assuming the first column (G) represents 2015 and each subsequent column is a year, the range is 2015 to 2021.
    - **Frequency**: Annual
- **Key Components**: Street - MH, Street - EVG, Terminal, Grand Total, % of Street - MH, % of Street - EVG, % of Total - Terminal, Utilization Rate.
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section calculates percentages and utilization rates based on the usage data.

### Section Name: Revenue and Cost Analysis
- **Section Type**: Custom P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: This section analyzes revenue and costs associated with different business activities (EVG Street, Terminal) to determine profitability. It breaks down revenue sources, cost components, and calculates per-day costs.

    - **Column Headers Location**: H16:Q16
    - **Data Range**:
      - Annual data: H17:Q74
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: The data in H16:Q16 is not explicitly labeled with dates, but the context suggests an annual time series. Assuming the first column (H) represents 2015 and each subsequent column is a year, the range is 2015 to 2021.
    - **Frequency**: Annual
- **Key Components**: Revenue, EVG Street Costs, Terminal Billings, M&R Cost, Admin Expense, Repo Expense, Other Expense, Lease Costs.
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section includes calculations for per-usage-day costs and incorporates various lease cost components. It also includes annual inflation assumptions in U32:V41.

### Section Name: EBITDA Calculation
- **Section Type**: Standard P&L
- **Description & Purpose**: This section calculates EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) based on the revenue and cost analysis. It also calculates EBITDA per usage day and EBITDA margin.
- **Cell Range**: B76:Q79

    - **Data Range**:
      - Annual data: H76:Q79
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: The data in H16:Q16 is not explicitly labeled with dates, but the context suggests an annual time series. Assuming the first column (H) represents 2015 and each subsequent column is a year, the range is 2015 to 2021.
    - **Frequency**: Annual
- **Key Components**: EBITDA, EBITDA per Usage Day, EBITDA per Chassis per Day, EBITDA Margin (%).
- **Notes & Customizations**: The section calculates EBITDA and related metrics based on the preceding revenue and cost analysis.

### Section Name: Chassis Acquisition Analysis
- **Section Type**: Key Metrics Table
- **Description & Purpose**: This section analyzes the costs associated with acquiring chassis, including purchase price, reconditioning, decoupling, repositioning, and other related expenses. It calculates the total effective purchase price.
- **Cell Range**: B82:G100

    - **Data Range**: G83:G98, G100
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**: This section represents a single period or upfront analysis, not a time series.
    - **Frequency**: N/A
- **Key Components**: Chassis to be Acquired, Average Book Value / Owned Chassis, Price per Chassis, Payment to EVG, Sales Tax, Total Chassis Price, Reconditioning Costs, Decouping Costs, Repositioning, Working Capital Investment, Total Effective Purchase Price, Cash Multiple of 2014 EBITDA - Owned.
- **Notes & Customizations**: This section focuses on the upfront costs associated with acquiring chassis.

### Section Name: Cash Flow Projections
- **Section Type**: Cash Flow Projections
- **Description & Purpose**: This section projects cash flows based on the investment in chassis, including depreciation, EBIT, taxes, and Capex. It calculates total cash flows and unlevered IRR. There are two separate cash flow projections, one based on a depreciated value exit and another based on a TEV exit.
- **Cell Range**: B104:Q136
- **Layout Structure**:
    - **Row Headers Location**: B104:B119, B121:B136
    - **Column Headers Location**: G104:Q104, G121:L121
    - **Data Range**:

      - Annual data (TEV Exit): H125:L132, G134
- **Time Series Details**:
    - **Date Range**:
      - Annual (Depreciated Value Exit): 2015 to 2021 (assuming H represents 2015)
      - Annual (TEV Exit): 1979 to 1979 (based on date_series_definitions)
    - **Frequency**:
      - Annual (Depreciated Value Exit)
